## Example of a Notepad Markdown Document

### My attempt to create a document from scratch in Notepad. 

I just started typing in notepad. Then I saved as a '.md' text file.

* It's kind of like xedit
* I'm not sure I remember all of those commands.

One of the features is the /n new line character.
